# Business Requirements – Netflix Content Analytics Dashboard

## 1. Background
Netflix adds content from many countries and across a wide range of genres every year. As the content library grows, it becomes difficult to clearly understand what type of content dominates the platform, which regions contribute the most, and how Netflix’s content strategy has evolved over time without analyzing the data in a single, consolidated view.

This project aims to organize Netflix content data into a clear and interactive format that supports better analysis and informed decision-making.

- Understand the overall composition of Netflix content
- Identify dominant content types, genres, and regions
- Analyze audience targeting through content ratings
- Track how content additions have changed over time

## 3. Key Business Questions
The dashboard is built to answer the following business questions:

1. How many total titles are available on Netflix, and how are they divided between Movies and TV Shows?
2. Does Netflix focus more on Movies or TV Shows, and what is the difference between them?
3. Which content ratings (such as TV-MA, TV-14, PG-13) are most common on the platform?
4. Based on the rating distribution, which audience age groups is Netflix mainly targeting?
5. Which countries contribute the highest number of titles to Netflix’s content library?
6. How does the balance between Movies and TV Shows differ across countries?
